## For translators!

Hi, it's very happy to have your help here.

For localisation, please visit ``_i18n`` folder and fill in your translation.
- In root of ``_i18n`` folder, create a file named ``<language_code>``.yml where ``<language_code>`` is the code of your language. Translate the content from the en.yml file.
    - Create a new folder with your language code, copy all files from the en folder to your language folder and start translating them. Do not rename file, translate their content only.
    - You can either clone this and translate, then push, or you can use Github editor. Search for tutorial online on how to create file and folder :D

Additionally, please add your language in:
- *languages*, *languageNames* field in _config.yml file.
- data/navigation.yml file.

## For native speakers!

Hi, if you have came here then you might be finding some translation errors or just some grammar mistakes from the original english sources.
