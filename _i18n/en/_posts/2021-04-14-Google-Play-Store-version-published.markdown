The Google Play Store version of the emulator has been approved and is published by **Play Software**. Here is the [Download link](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.github.eka2l1).
The Download section of the website will be changed accordingly.

If you are not a fan of cutting-edge changes and regularly download then reinstall APK from Github again, this version on Google Play Store can be seen as a stable release channel for the emulator.
We hope you will continue to support the emulator.

The version on the Play Store is based on commit [5f1c683](https://github.com/EKA2L1/EKA2L1/commit/5f1c68345e0ae4c8a84006fe86056a4fbb832c22) on *Master* branch.
