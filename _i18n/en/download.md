## Note for Windows

The Windows version requires you to have installed the newest *Microsoft Visual C++*. If you encounter any errors stating that you are missing a DLL, try
to install the runtime from [this link](https://support.microsoft.com/en-US/help/2977003/the-latest-supported-visual-c-downloads).

## Note for Android

At the moment, support for Android **(especially 32-bit version)** is still *in experimental phase*, therefore, the amount of apps working normally can be different (or less)
from the PC version.

When you encounter a situation where the app you want to run works normally on PC version of emulator, but not on Android version, please contact the developers through [Discord](https://discord.gg/5Bm5SJ9),
or open an issue on [Github](https://github.com/EKA2L1/EKA2L1/issues).
